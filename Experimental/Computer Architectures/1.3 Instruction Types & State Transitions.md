# Instruction Types & State Transitions

_Types of instructions and operands, architectural types, regular architectures, state space and state transitions_

## Instruction Types

- **Data Movement**  
  - Transfer between registers, memory, I/O  
  - e.g. `MOV`, `LOAD`, `STORE`  

- **Arithmetic & Logic**  
  - Integer/floating ops, bitwise logic  
  - e.g. `ADD`, `SUB`, `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`  

- **Control Transfer**  
  - Sequential flow modifications  
  - e.g. unconditional jumps (`JMP`), conditional branches (`BEQ`)  

- **System & Privileged**  
  - Change CPU mode, manage memory, I/O  
  - e.g. `INT` (software interrupt), `HLT` (halt)  

- **Input/Output**  
  - Interface with external devices  
  - e.g. `IN`, `OUT`, memory-mapped I/O  

## Operands

| Type        | Description                                    |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Immediate   | Constant encoded in the instruction            |
| Register    | CPU register specified by name or index        |
| Memory      | Address or effective address in RAM            |
| Implicit    | Operand implied by opcode (e.g. accumulator)   |
| Relative    | PC-relative offset for branches or data pools  |

## Architectural Styles

| Architecture | Characteristics                                                                     |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CISC**     | Many complex instructions, variable length, rich addressing modes, microcode‐driven |
| **RISC**     | Fixed‐length, simple instructions, load/store architecture, optimized for pipelines |
| **VLIW**     | Bundles of operations issued in parallel, compiler handles scheduling               |
| **EPIC**     | Explicit parallelism with predication, speculative execution (e.g. Intel Itanium)   |

## State Transitions (Instruction Cycle)

A single instruction typically passes through these CPU states:

- **Fetch**  
  Retrieve instruction bits from memory at the Program Counter (PC).

- **Decode**  
  Identify opcode, operand types, addressing modes; set up control signals.

- **Execute**  
  Perform ALU or branch operations, address calculations.

- **Memory Access**  
  For load/store: read from or write to data memory.

- **Write-Back**  
  Store results in registers or status flags; increment PC.

> **Pipeline Note**: In pipelined CPUs, multiple instructions occupy different stages simultaneously, improving throughput but requiring hazard management.

## Regular Architectures

**Definition:** Architectures with a uniform instruction format and a consistent set of registers, addressing modes, and state elements.  
**Examples:**  
- **RISC** (e.g., ARM, MIPS) – fixed-length instructions, simple encoding  
- **Load/Store** – only memory ops for load/store; ALU ops on registers  
- **Uniform Register File** – all registers are identical, no special-purpose ones  

**Benefits:**  
- Simplified decoding  
- Easier pipelining  
- Predictable performance  

## State Space

The **state space** of a CPU is the collection of all values that define its execution context at any moment.  

| Component                     | Description                             |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **General-Purpose Registers** | Values for computation (e.g., R0–R31)   |
| **Program Counter (PC)**      | Address of next instruction             |
| **Status Flags**              | Condition codes (Zero, Carry, Negative) |
| **Memory State**              | Contents of RAM and cache lines         |
| **Control Registers**         | MMU settings, interrupt masks           |

> The total state is the Cartesian product of all possible values of these components.

## State Transitions

**Instruction execution** drives transitions in state space. Each step moves from one global state to the next:

1. **Fetch**  
   - PC → Instruction Register  
   - PC ← PC + instruction_length  

2. **Decode**  
   - Parse opcode, identify operands and addressing mode  
   - Prepare control signals  

3. **Execute**  
   - Perform ALU operation or branch test  
   - Compute effective addresses for memory ops  

4. **Memory Access**  
   - **Load:** read memory → register  
   - **Store:** register → write memory  

5. **Write-Back**  
   - Update destination register or flags  
   - Finalize PC (for taken branches/jumps)

| Transition              | Causes                             |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **State →** Fetch       | Memory read of next instruction    |
| **Fetch →** Decode      | Instruction bits available in IR   |
| **Decode →** Execute    | Control signals asserted           |
| **Execute →** MemAcc    | Address computed, memory op needed |
| **MemAcc →** Write-Back | Data routed to register or flags   |
| **Write-Back →** Fetch  | Next PC value determined           |

## Why It Matters

- **Verification & Debugging:** Mapping all possible state transitions helps catch invalid behaviors.  
- **Performance:** Optimizing common transitions (e.g., ALU-only vs. memory-heavy) improves throughput.  
- **Security:** Ensuring illegal state transitions (e.g., user → kernel) are prevented.
