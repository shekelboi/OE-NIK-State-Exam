## Data Files & Manipulations

### Definition
- **Data File**: A collection of related records stored on secondary storage (e.g., HDD, SSD).  
- **Manipulation**: Operations like create, read, update, delete (CRUD) performed via file-handling APIs or database engines.

### Memory Overview
Computers organize information in **memory** hierarchies:

1. **Primary Memory**  
   - **RAM** (volatile): Fast, directly accessible by CPU.  
   - **Cache**: Even faster, smaller, sits between CPU and RAM.  
2. **Secondary Memory**  
   - **Hard Drives / SSDs** (non-volatile): Larger capacity, slower access.  
   - **Network Storage**: Remote disks, even slower but shareable.

### Logical vs. Physical Memory

| Aspect               | Logical Memory                                 | Physical Memory                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | Address space as seen by a program (virtual).  | Actual hardware addresses in RAM.               |
| **Size**             | Typically larger (depends on OS, 64-bit arch). | Limited by installed RAM modules.               |
| **Management Layer** | Handled by OS’s Memory Management Unit (MMU).  | Managed by hardware + OS kernel.                |
| **Mapping**          | Virtual → Physical via page tables.            | Direct cell addresses, non-paged.               |
| **Protection**       | Provides isolation (per-process).              | No inherent isolation—hardware enforces access. |

### Why This Matters
- **Performance**:  
  - Logical paging/swapping can slow file operations if memory is tight.  
  - Caching data files in RAM speeds up reads/writes.

- **Reliability & Safety**:  
  - Logical separation avoids one program corrupting another’s data.  
  - Proper manipulation APIs ensure atomic updates and prevent data loss.

### Manipulation Workflow
1. **Open File** (or map into memory)  
2. **Read/Write** via buffers (in logical space)  
3. **Sync/Flush** to physical disk  
4. **Close File** (release logical pages, free physical frames)

## Registers vs Memory

**Registers**
- Small, ultra-fast storage locations inside the CPU  
- Hold operands and results of arithmetic/logic operations  
- Typically ≤ 32 or 64 in number (architecture-dependent)  
- Addressed by register names (e.g. `R1`, `AX`, `EAX`)  

**Main Memory (RAM)**
- Larger, slower storage outside the CPU  
- Holds program instructions, data files, stack, heap  
- Addressed by numeric memory addresses (e.g. `0x3F2A0C`)  
- Access involves bus transactions and higher latency  

| Characteristic | Registers                 | Main Memory                |
|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Size           | Tens to hundreds of bytes | Gigabytes                  |
| Access Time    | ~1 CPU cycle              | Tens to hundreds of cycles |
| Addressing     | By name/index             | By numeric address         |
| Typical Use    | Temporary values, flags   | Bulk data, code, files     |

## Addressing Modes

- **Immediate**  
  Operand is specified directly in the instruction (e.g. `MOV R0, #5`).  

- **Register**  
  Operand resides in a CPU register (e.g. `ADD R1, R2`).  

- **Direct (Absolute)**  
  Instruction contains a memory address (e.g. `LOAD R0, [0x1000]`).  

- **Indirect**  
  Uses a register whose content is a memory address (e.g. `STORE R1, [R5]`).  

- **Indexed**  
  Base address plus an index offset (explained below).  

- **Relative**  
  Address computed relative to the program counter (e.g. for branches).  

## Indexed Addressing

- Combines a **base register** and an **index register** (or immediate offset)  
- Effective Address = Base + Index × Scale + Displacement  
- Common in array and table accesses  

| Component    | Role                               |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| Base         | Starting address (e.g. array base) |
| Index        | Offset register or constant        |
| Scale        | Multiplier for index (1, 2, 4, 8)  |
| Displacement | Additional constant offset         |

**Example (x86 syntax)**  

`MOV EAX, [EBX + ECX*4 + 16]`

- EBX: base address of an integer array  
- ECX: index (element number)  
- 4: size of each element (bytes)  
- 16: extra displacement  

**Why Indexed Addressing Matters**  
- Simplifies access to array elements and records in data files  
- Reduces instruction count by embedding address calculation in memory access  
- Enhances performance in loop-based data manipulations
