## Performance Metric & Instruction Set Architecture

_Classes of Computers, Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), CPU clocking, CPU time, instruction count and CPI, MIPS_

### Classes of Computers
- **Microcomputers:** Small, personal use (e.g., PCs, laptops).
- **Minicomputers:** Mid-sized, multi-user systems.
- **Mainframes:** Large, powerful systems for enterprises.
- **Supercomputers:** Extremely fast, used for complex computations.

### Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- Defines the interface between software and hardware.
- Specifies:
  - **Instructions** the CPU can execute.
  - **Data types** supported.
  - **Registers** available.
  - **Addressing modes.**
  - **Memory architecture.**
- Types of ISAs:
  - **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing):** Many complex instructions.
  - **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing):** Simple, fast instructions.

### CPU Clocking
- **Clock cycle:** Basic time unit for CPU operations.
- **Clock rate:** Number of clock cycles per second (Hz).
- CPU speed depends on clock rate and cycles per instruction.
- Higher clock rate → faster execution but more power consumption.
- Modern CPUs use pipelining and multi-core to improve performance beyond clock speed.

### Performance Metrics
- **Execution time:** Time to complete a task.
- **MIPS:** Million Instructions Per Second (measures instruction throughput).
- **FLOPS:** Floating Point Operations Per Second (used in scientific computing).
- Factors affecting performance:
  - Clock speed.
  - Instruction count.
  - Cycles per instruction (CPI).

## CPU Time
- **Definition:** Total time CPU spends executing a program.
- **Formula:**
  - `CPU Time = Instruction Count × Cycles per Instruction × Clock Cycle Time
= Instruction Count × CPI × (1 / Clock Rate)`

- **Implications:**  
- Lower CPI or higher clock rate reduces CPU time.  
- Optimizing compiler and hardware (pipelining, superscalar) target CPI reduction.

## Instruction Count & CPI
- **Instruction Count (IC):**  
- Total number of instructions executed by the program.  
- Depends on ISA complexity and compiler optimizations.
- **Cycles per Instruction (CPI):**  
- Average number of clock cycles each instruction takes.  
- Influenced by instruction mix, pipeline hazards, cache misses.
- **Comparison Table:**

| Factor             | Effect on IC       | Effect on CPI                  |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Complex ISA (CISC) | ↓ (more work/inst) | ↑ (more cycles/inst)           |
| Simple ISA (RISC)  | ↑ (more insts)     | ↓ (fewer cycles/inst)          |
| Loop unrolling     | ↓ (fewer branches) | ↑ (more instructions per loop) |
| Pipelining         | —                  | ↓ (closer to 1)                |

## MIPS
- **Definition:** Millions of Instructions Per Second.
