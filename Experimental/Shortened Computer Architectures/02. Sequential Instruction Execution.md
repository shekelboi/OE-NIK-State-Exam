# Sequential Instruction Execution

### What Happens Step-by-Step?

When a CPU runs a program, it **executes instructions sequentially** unless told otherwise (like with jumps). The basic types are:

---

### **Arithmetic Instructions**

These perform math.

* `ADD R1, R2, R3` → `R1 = R2 + R3`
* `SUB`, `MUL`, `DIV`, etc.

They often set special bits called flags in a status register to reflect the result (like Zero, Negative, Overflow).

---

### **Load/Store Instructions**

Because CPUs operate on registers, **you load data from memory** into a register, and **store it back** when needed.

* `LDR R1, [R2]` → Load from memory address in R2 to R1
* `STR R1, [R2]` → Store R1’s value to memory address in R2

These are crucial in **load-store architectures** like RISC.

### **Control Flow: Jumps and Branches**

* **Unconditional jump**
  `B label` → Always jumps to `label`

* **Conditional jump**
  `BEQ label` → Branch if Equal (i.e., Zero flag is set)

Other conditions include:

* `BNE` (not equal)
* `BLT` (less than)
* `BGT` (greater than)

They use flags set by arithmetic ops.
