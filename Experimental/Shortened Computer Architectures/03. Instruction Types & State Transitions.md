# Instruction Types & State Transitions

### Instruction Types & Operands

* **Instruction Types:**

  * **Arithmetic/Logic:** ADD, SUB, AND, OR
  * **Data Movement:** LOAD, STORE, MOVE
  * **Control Flow:** JUMP, BRANCH, CALL, RETURN
  * **Special:** System calls, interrupts

* **Operands:**

  * **Registers:** Fast, inside CPU
  * **Memory:** Slower, main memory
  * **Immediate:** Constant values embedded in instructions

### Architectural Types

* **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer):**
  Instructions can do complex tasks, varying lengths, multiple cycles. Examples: x86.

* **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer):**
  Simplified, fixed-length instructions, executed in a single cycle, load/store architecture. Examples: ARM.

* **Regular architectures:**
  Architectures designed so instruction formats and operations follow predictable patterns, making decoding easier.

### State Space & State Transitions

* The CPU has a set of internal states (e.g., Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, Write Back).

* **State space** is the collection of all possible states the CPU can be in during instruction processing.

* **State transitions** are how the CPU moves from one state to another in a sequence to complete each instruction.

* This formal model helps design control units and verify correctness.
