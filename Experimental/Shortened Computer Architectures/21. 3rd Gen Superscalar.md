# 3rd Gen Superscalar

### Three-Operand Instructions

* Unlike two-operand formats (where one input is also the output), these allow:

  ```
  ADD R1, R2, R3  // R1 = R2 + R3
  ```
* This avoids overwriting source registers and improves ILP.

---

### SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)

* Executes the **same instruction on multiple data elements** in parallel.
* Great for multimedia and vector processing (e.g., graphics, video, audio).
* Uses **vector registers** and **vector instructions**.

---

### Vector Multimedia Instructions

* Specialized SIMD instructions for multimedia workloads (e.g., MMX, SSE, AVX).
* Accelerates tasks like image processing, physics in games, and AI operations.

---

### VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word)

* Packs **multiple operations into one long instruction** issued together.
* Parallelism is handled by the **compiler**, not the CPU.
* Pros: simpler hardware; Cons: harder to optimize for all workloads.
