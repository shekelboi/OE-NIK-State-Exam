# Memory Subsystem Evolution

### Channel Attachment

* Modern CPUs support **multi-channel memory** — e.g., dual, quad, or even octa-channel setups.
* More channels = more bandwidth. Each channel operates independently, allowing simultaneous data transfers.

### Bandwidth

* Memory bandwidth is crucial for feeding data to high-performance CPUs, especially in servers and workstations.
* Evolving standards (DDR3 → DDR4 → DDR5) increase bandwidth and efficiency while reducing latency.

### Direct/Indirect Interfaces

* **Direct interfaces** connect memory controllers straight to RAM (common in modern systems — e.g., Intel’s IMC).
* **Indirect interfaces** use intermediaries like Northbridge or memory hubs — slower, older design.
* Direct memory access improves speed and simplifies architecture.
