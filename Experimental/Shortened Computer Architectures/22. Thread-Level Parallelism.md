# Thread-Level Parallelism (TLP)

### Why TLP?

* As **single-core CPUs hit performance limits** (power, heat, clock speed), adding more **cores** became the solution.
* TLP improves performance by running **multiple threads** in parallel across cores or hardware threads.

---

### Single-Core Limitations

* You can only do so much in one thread: limited ILP, pipeline depth, and frequency scaling.
* **Diminishing returns** from superscalar tricks â†’ need to go multithreaded.

### Forms of Multithreading

1. **Coarse-Grain Multithreading:**

   * Switches threads only on big stalls (e.g., cache miss).
   * Simple, but less responsive.

2. **Fine-Grain Multithreading:**

   * Switches every cycle, interleaves instructions from multiple threads.
   * Hides latency better, but more complex.

3. **Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT):**

   * Runs **multiple threads in parallel** using the same core and functional units.
   * Example: Intel Hyper-Threading.

### SMT vs. Single-Threaded Execution

* **SMT increases utilization** of execution units by filling idle slots with instructions from other threads.
* Can **improve throughput**, but not always per-thread speed.
