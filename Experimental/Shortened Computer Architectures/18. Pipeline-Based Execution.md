# Pipeline-Based Execution

### Pipeline Basics

* A pipeline breaks down instruction execution into several **stages** (fetch, decode, execute, memory access, write-back).
* Each stage performs part of the work for an instruction.
* At every clock cycle, a new instruction enters the pipeline, while others advance to the next stage.
* This creates a **continuous flow** improving instruction throughput.

### Logical vs. Physical Pipeline

* **Logical pipeline:** Conceptual division of execution steps.
* **Physical pipeline:** Actual hardware units implementing these stages.

Sometimes, stages are combined or split depending on the CPU design.

### Pipeline Characteristics

* Ideal pipelines process one instruction per clock cycle once filled.
* Real pipelines face stalls or hazards, causing delays.
* Pipeline depth (number of stages) affects latency and throughput.
