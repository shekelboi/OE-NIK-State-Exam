# Intel vs. AMD I

### IC Tech Competition

* Both companies have raced to advance **integrated circuit (IC) technology**: transistor size, density, and manufacturing process.
* Shrinking transistors (Moore’s Law) led to better performance and efficiency.
* This competition drives continuous innovation in chip design and fabrication, impacting power consumption, heat dissipation, and overall CPU capabilities.
* Manufacturing breakthroughs often decide market leadership as smaller, denser chips deliver faster speeds and improved battery life in mobile devices.

### Transistor Growth Rate

* Intel historically led transistor scaling, pushing smaller nodes faster and more aggressively than AMD.
* AMD often caught up or innovated with different design choices, such as chiplet architectures and multi-core designs to offset process disadvantages.
* Intel’s early adoption of smaller nodes allowed it to deliver higher transistor density and clock speeds for many years.
* AMD’s strategy included leveraging external foundries like TSMC, enabling access to advanced manufacturing processes despite lacking its own fabs.

### Intel Tech Development

* Intel’s focus on **process technology** allowed aggressive clock speeds and power efficiency, giving it a performance edge.
* Developed major fabrication advancements like **High-k metal gate**, which reduced leakage current and power consumption.
* Pioneered **FinFET (Tri-gate) transistors** that improved switching speed and reduced short-channel effects.
* These innovations helped Intel maintain dominance for years, though recent delays in smaller node transitions have given AMD opportunities to catch up.
* Intel’s massive investment in manufacturing infrastructure also contributed significantly to its technological lead.
