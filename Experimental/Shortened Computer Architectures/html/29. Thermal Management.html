<h3 id="dissipation-focus">Dissipation Focus</h3>
<ul>
<li>Modern CPUs generate significant heat; managing this is critical for
performance and reliability.</li>
<li>Thermal dissipation involves transferring heat away from the CPU to
prevent overheating.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="reduction-methods">Reduction Methods</h3>
<ul>
<li>Techniques include improved cooling solutions (air, liquid), heat
spreaders, and heat pipes.</li>
<li>Architectural methods like dynamic voltage and frequency scaling
(DVFS) reduce power under load.</li>
<li>Power gating shuts off unused parts of the chip to save energy and
reduce heat.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="thermal-reserves">Thermal Reserves</h3>
<ul>
<li>CPUs include thermal headroomâ€”extra margin before hitting critical
temperatures.</li>
<li>This allows short bursts of high performance without immediate
throttling.</li>
<li>Efficient thermal management balances performance with longevity and
user comfort.</li>
</ul>
