<h1 id="sequential-consistency">Sequential Consistency</h1>
<h3 id="what-does-it-mean">What Does It Mean?</h3>
<p>Sequential consistency ensures that the results of execution are
<strong>as if all instructions were executed in program order</strong>,
across all cores or threads. Even if actual execution is out of order
(for performance), it must appear ordered.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="instruction-and-memory-order"><strong>Instruction and Memory
Order</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>All processors execute instructions in a way that seems
<strong>interleaved</strong>,</li>
<li>But <strong>each processorâ€™s own instructions stay in
order</strong>.</li>
<li>No processor sees memory effects from another out of the expected
order.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="interrupt-consistency"><strong>Interrupt
Consistency</strong></h3>
<p>If an interrupt occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must appear <strong>after all previous instructions</strong> in
that core have completed.</li>
<li>This ensures a <strong>predictable system state</strong> when
handling exceptions or events.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="reorder-buffer-rob"><strong>Reorder Buffer (ROB)</strong></h3>
<p>A ROB tracks and holds instructions that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Execute <strong>out of order</strong>, but</li>
<li><strong>Commit results in order</strong> to memory and
registers.</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes execution faster but preserves consistency.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="reservation-stations"><strong>Reservation Stations</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Hold instructions waiting for operands.</li>
<li>Instructions <strong>wake up</strong> when data becomes available
(e.g., from another unit).</li>
<li>Allows more <strong>parallelism</strong> without breaking program
order at commit time.</li>
</ul>
