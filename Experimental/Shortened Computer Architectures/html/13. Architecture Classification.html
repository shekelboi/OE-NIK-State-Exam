<h1 id="architecture-classification">Architecture Classification</h1>
<h3 id="flynns-taxonomy"><strong>Flynn’s Taxonomy</strong></h3>
<p>A classic way to categorize computer architectures based on
<strong>instruction and data streams</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>SISD</strong> – <em>Single Instruction, Single Data</em>
Traditional sequential processors (like classic CPUs).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SIMD</strong> – <em>Single Instruction, Multiple
Data</em> One instruction acts on many data points. Used in vector
processing and multimedia (e.g., GPUs, SSE/AVX).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MISD</strong> – <em>Multiple Instruction, Single
Data</em> Rare or theoretical. Multiple processors perform different
operations on the same data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MIMD</strong> – <em>Multiple Instruction, Multiple
Data</em> Common in multicore/multiprocessor systems. Each core runs its
own instruction stream on different data.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="modern-classifications"><strong>Modern
Classifications</strong></h3>
<p>Newer systems can blur these lines, so we also see terms like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Superscalar</strong> – Executes multiple instructions per
cycle from a single thread.</li>
<li><strong>VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word)</strong> – Groups several
operations into one wide instruction.</li>
<li><strong>SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Threads)</strong> – Like
SIMD, but each thread can follow its own control flow (common in
GPUs).</li>
</ul>
