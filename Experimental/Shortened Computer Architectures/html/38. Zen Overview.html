<h1 id="zen-overview">Zen Overview</h1>
<h3 id="withwithout-gpu">With/Without GPU</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some Zen-based CPUs include integrated graphics (APUs), like the
Ryzen G-series (e.g., 3200G, 3400G).</li>
<li>Others, especially high-performance models (Ryzen 7/9,
Threadripper), come <strong>without</strong> a GPU, requiring a discrete
graphics card.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="apu-highlights">APU Highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>APUs combine Zen CPU cores with Vega GPU cores.</li>
<li>Ideal for budget systems or compact builds needing decent graphics
without a separate GPU.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="packaging">Packaging</h3>
<ul>
<li>Zen CPUs use a <strong>modular chiplet design</strong>, allowing for
flexibility across product lines.</li>
<li>Desktop CPUs often use AM4 sockets, while server and HEDT chips use
larger packages (e.g., sTRX4, SP3).</li>
<li>Multi-chip packages improve manufacturing and scalability,
especially for high core counts.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="pro-models">Pro Models</h3>
<ul>
<li>AMD offers <strong>Ryzen Pro</strong> models targeting business
users.</li>
<li>Features include hardware security (like Memory Guard), longer
lifecycle, and commercial-grade reliability.</li>
<li>Pro variants exist across desktop and mobile lines, often mirroring
regular Ryzen SKUs with added features.</li>
</ul>
