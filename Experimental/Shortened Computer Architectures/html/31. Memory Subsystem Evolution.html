<h3 id="channel-attachment">Channel Attachment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Modern CPUs support <strong>multi-channel memory</strong> — e.g.,
dual, quad, or even octa-channel setups.</li>
<li>More channels = more bandwidth. Each channel operates independently,
allowing simultaneous data transfers.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="bandwidth">Bandwidth</h3>
<ul>
<li>Memory bandwidth is crucial for feeding data to high-performance
CPUs, especially in servers and workstations.</li>
<li>Evolving standards (DDR3 → DDR4 → DDR5) increase bandwidth and
efficiency while reducing latency.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="directindirect-interfaces">Direct/Indirect Interfaces</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct interfaces</strong> connect memory controllers
straight to RAM (common in modern systems — e.g., Intel’s IMC).</li>
<li><strong>Indirect interfaces</strong> use intermediaries like
Northbridge or memory hubs — slower, older design.</li>
<li>Direct memory access improves speed and simplifies
architecture.</li>
</ul>
