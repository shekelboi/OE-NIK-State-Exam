<h1 id="data-dependencies">Data Dependencies</h1>
<h3 id="what-are-they"><strong>What Are They?</strong></h3>
<p>In a pipeline or parallel execution environment, <strong>data
dependencies</strong> determine whether instructions can execute
independently or must wait on each other.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="types-of-data-dependencies"><strong>Types of Data
Dependencies</strong></h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>RAW (Read After Write)</strong> — <em>True
Dependency</em><br> An instruction needs a value that hasn’t been
computed yet.</p>
<pre><code>ADD R1, R2, R3
SUB R4, R1, R5   ; must wait for ADD</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>WAR (Write After Read)</strong> —
<em>Anti-Dependency</em><br> A write might overwrite a value that needs
to be read first.</p>
<pre><code>READ R1
WRITE R1         ; must wait for read to finish</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>WAW (Write After Write)</strong> — <em>Output
Dependency</em><br> Two instructions write to the same register — must
preserve the order.</p>
<pre><code>WRITE R1
WRITE R1         ; later write must go last</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="why-do-they-matter"><strong>Why Do They Matter?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hazards</strong> in the pipeline stall execution.</li>
<li><strong>Out-of-order execution</strong> and <strong>register
renaming</strong> are used to hide or resolve them.</li>
<li>Instruction-level parallelism (ILP) depends heavily on minimizing
these dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="register-renaming"><strong>Register Renaming</strong></h3>
<p>Registers are limited and reused in programs, which can cause false
dependencies (especially WAR and WAW).</p>
<p><strong>Register renaming</strong> solves this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mapping architectural registers (the ones programmers see) to a
larger pool of <strong>physical registers</strong>.</li>
<li>This way, two instructions writing to the same architectural
register can use different physical registers, removing false
dependencies.</li>
<li>Result: better instruction-level parallelism because the CPU sees
them as independent.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="out-of-order-execution"><strong>Out-of-Order
Execution</strong></h3>
<p>Normally, instructions execute in program order, but this can cause
stalls due to dependencies or resource waits.</p>
<p>Out-of-order execution lets the CPU:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Execute instructions as soon as their operands are
ready</strong>, even if earlier instructions are still waiting.</li>
<li>Uses buffers and reorder mechanisms to keep results consistent.</li>
<li>Improves CPU utilization and performance by reducing idle time.</li>
</ul>
