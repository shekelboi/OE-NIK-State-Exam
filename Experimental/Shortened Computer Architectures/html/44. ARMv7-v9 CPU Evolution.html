<h3 id="bit-to-64-bit-transition">32-bit to 64-bit Transition</h3>
<ul>
<li>ARMv7 is a 32-bit architecture widely used in older devices.</li>
<li>ARMv8 introduced 64-bit support (AArch64), enabling larger memory
addressing and improved performance.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="big.little-development">big.LITTLE Development</h3>
<ul>
<li>Evolved from ARMv7 big.LITTLE to more sophisticated implementations
in ARMv8 and ARMv9.</li>
<li>Modern designs allow finer-grained power management and more dynamic
core usage.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="armv8.2-and-armv9-advancements">ARMv8.2 and ARMv9
Advancements</h3>
<ul>
<li>ARMv8.2 added features like improved virtualization, enhanced
cryptography, and better floating-point performance.</li>
<li>ARMv9 focuses on security (confidential computing), AI acceleration,
and further performance improvements.</li>
</ul>
