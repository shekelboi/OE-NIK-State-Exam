<h1 id="intel-vs.-amd-i">Intel vs. AMD I</h1>
<h3 id="ic-tech-competition">IC Tech Competition</h3>
<ul>
<li>Both companies have raced to advance <strong>integrated circuit (IC)
technology</strong>: transistor size, density, and manufacturing
process.</li>
<li>Shrinking transistors (Moore’s Law) led to better performance and
efficiency.</li>
<li>This competition drives continuous innovation in chip design and
fabrication, impacting power consumption, heat dissipation, and overall
CPU capabilities.</li>
<li>Manufacturing breakthroughs often decide market leadership as
smaller, denser chips deliver faster speeds and improved battery life in
mobile devices.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="transistor-growth-rate">Transistor Growth Rate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Intel historically led transistor scaling, pushing smaller nodes
faster and more aggressively than AMD.</li>
<li>AMD often caught up or innovated with different design choices, such
as chiplet architectures and multi-core designs to offset process
disadvantages.</li>
<li>Intel’s early adoption of smaller nodes allowed it to deliver higher
transistor density and clock speeds for many years.</li>
<li>AMD’s strategy included leveraging external foundries like TSMC,
enabling access to advanced manufacturing processes despite lacking its
own fabs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="intel-tech-development">Intel Tech Development</h3>
<ul>
<li>Intel’s focus on <strong>process technology</strong> allowed
aggressive clock speeds and power efficiency, giving it a performance
edge.</li>
<li>Developed major fabrication advancements like <strong>High-k metal
gate</strong>, which reduced leakage current and power consumption.</li>
<li>Pioneered <strong>FinFET (Tri-gate) transistors</strong> that
improved switching speed and reduced short-channel effects.</li>
<li>These innovations helped Intel maintain dominance for years, though
recent delays in smaller node transitions have given AMD opportunities
to catch up.</li>
<li>Intel’s massive investment in manufacturing infrastructure also
contributed significantly to its technological lead.</li>
</ul>
