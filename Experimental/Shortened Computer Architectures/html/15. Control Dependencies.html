<h3 id="what-are-control-dependencies"><strong>What Are Control
Dependencies?</strong></h3>
<p>Control dependencies occur when the execution of certain instructions
depends on the outcome of a previous branch or jump instruction. In
other words, whether or not an instruction executes depends on a
decision made during runtime. This is common with conditional branches
where the CPU must decide which path of the program to follow next.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="why-they-are-important"><strong>Why They Are
Important</strong></h3>
<p>Branches and jumps interrupt the smooth, sequential flow of
instructions in a pipeline. Since the CPU doesnâ€™t know the outcome of a
branch until it is evaluated, it must either wait (stall) or guess the
path. Waiting reduces performance, but guessing incorrectly means the
CPU has to discard work it has already started, which wastes cycles and
energy.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="types-of-branches"><strong>Types of Branches</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conditional Branches</strong>: These depend on a
condition (e.g., a comparison between registers). For example, a branch
that only executes if two values are equal (<code>BEQ</code>). The CPU
must evaluate the condition before continuing, which can cause
delays.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unconditional Branches</strong>: These always cause a
jump to another instruction location, redirecting program flow without
any condition.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="branch-prediction-techniques"><strong>Branch Prediction
Techniques</strong></h3>
<p>To mitigate the delays caused by control dependencies, CPUs use
branch prediction:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Static Prediction</strong>: Assumes branches will always
be taken or not taken based on simple rules. For example, always
assuming backward loops are taken.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dynamic Prediction</strong>: Uses runtime information and
history to make smarter guesses about branch outcomes. This includes
techniques like local and global branch predictors that keep track of
past behavior to predict future branches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Speculative Execution</strong>: The CPU guesses the
branch outcome and continues executing instructions along that predicted
path before the actual branch result is known. If the guess is right,
the CPU saves time; if wrong, it must discard the speculative work and
recover.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Control dependencies are a key challenge for modern CPUs because
incorrect predictions cause pipeline flushes, leading to lost
performance. Advances in prediction accuracy have been crucial to
improving processor speed.</p>
