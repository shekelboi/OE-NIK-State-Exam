<h3 id="performance-race">Performance Race</h3>
<ul>
<li>After years of Intel’s dominance, AMD started closing the gap with
innovative CPU architectures and better multi-core designs.</li>
<li>AMD’s Ryzen and Epyc lines shook the market by offering high core
counts and competitive performance at lower prices.</li>
<li>Intel responded by tweaking microarchitecture, boosting clock
speeds, and refining fabrication.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="shift-reasons">Shift Reasons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Intel faced delays in moving to smaller manufacturing nodes (10nm
and below), impacting their ability to compete on efficiency and
speed.</li>
<li>AMD leveraged TSMC’s advanced 7nm and 5nm processes, gaining an edge
in power and performance.</li>
<li>Market demand shifted toward multi-core and energy-efficient CPUs,
favoring AMD’s chiplet and scalable designs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="arms-rise-and-impact">ARM’s Rise and Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>ARM’s low-power designs gained huge traction in mobile and data
center markets.</li>
<li>Intel and AMD had to adapt or compete with ARM-based processors
focusing on energy efficiency.</li>
<li>ARM’s licensing model encouraged diverse innovation, increasing
competition in CPU markets.</li>
</ul>
