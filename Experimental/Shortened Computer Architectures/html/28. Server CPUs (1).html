<h1 id="server-cpus">Server CPUs</h1>
<h3 id="core-counts">Core Counts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Server CPUs often have very high core counts — 32, 64, or more — to
handle many simultaneous tasks.</li>
<li>Designed to optimize throughput and efficiency across multiple
virtual machines and services.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="memory-bandwidth">Memory Bandwidth</h3>
<ul>
<li>Servers require high memory bandwidth to feed data-hungry
applications like databases and virtualization.</li>
<li>Multiple memory channels and support for large amounts of RAM
(hundreds of GBs to TBs) are common.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="uma-and-numa-architectures">UMA and NUMA Architectures</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uniform Memory Access (UMA):</strong> All processors share a
common memory space with uniform access latency.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA):</strong> Memory is divided
among processors, with faster local access and slower remote
access.</li>
<li>NUMA improves scalability in multi-socket systems but requires
software to manage memory locality.</li>
</ul>
