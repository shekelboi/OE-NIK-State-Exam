<h3 id="base-isa">Base ISA</h3>
<ul>
<li>ARMâ€™s Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) defines the instructions a
CPU understands.</li>
<li>The base ISA started with simple 32-bit instructions focused on RISC
principles (Reduced Instruction Set Computing).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="version-history">Version History</h3>
<ul>
<li>ARM ISA evolved through versions like ARMv4, v5, v6, v7, and the
recent 64-bit ARMv8 and ARMv9.</li>
<li>Each version added new features, improved performance, and expanded
capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="extension-focuses">Extension Focuses</h3>
<ul>
<li>Extensions include support for SIMD (NEON), virtualization, security
(TrustZone), and enhanced floating-point operations.</li>
<li>ARMv8 introduced AArch64, a 64-bit execution state, enabling larger
address spaces and improved performance.</li>
</ul>
