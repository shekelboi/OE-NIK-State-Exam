Architectures</h1>
<h3 id="evolution">Evolution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Introduced by ARM to combine high-performance cores with
energy-efficient cores in one chip.</li>
<li>Enables better power management by switching between cores based on
workload.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="operation-principle">Operation Principle</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big cores:</strong> High power, high performance, handle
heavy tasks.</li>
<li><strong>LITTLE cores:</strong> Low power, energy-efficient, handle
light or background tasks.</li>
<li>The system dynamically migrates tasks between big and LITTLE cores
for optimal efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved battery life without sacrificing performance.</li>
<li>Flexibility to balance speed and energy use depending on current
needs.</li>
</ul>
