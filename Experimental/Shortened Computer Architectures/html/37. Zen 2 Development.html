<h1 id="zen-2-development">Zen 2 Development</h1>
<h3 id="processor-types">Processor Types</h3>
<ul>
<li>Zen 2 powers the Ryzen 3000 series for desktops, the 2nd-gen Epyc
server processors (7002 series), and 3rd-gen Threadripper.</li>
<li>It brought significant IPC (instructions per cycle) improvements and
better power efficiency compared to the original Zen.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="chipset-selections">Chipset Selections</h3>
<ul>
<li>Zen 2 introduced support for new chipsets like AMDâ€™s X570, which was
the first to offer PCIe 4.0.</li>
<li>This provided faster data transfer rates, better memory support, and
enhanced I/O performance.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Built on a 7nm manufacturing process, Zen 2 chips have higher
transistor density, enabling more cores and better thermals.</li>
<li>The modular MCM design continued, with multiple chiplets connected
through Infinity Fabric, improving bandwidth and latency.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="architectural-improvements">Architectural Improvements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Redesigned core layout to reduce latency between cores and
caches.</li>
<li>Enhanced branch prediction and prefetching for higher
performance.</li>
<li>Improved security features with mitigations for Spectre and Meltdown
vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
