<h1 id="mobile-revolution">Mobile Revolution</h1>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<ul>
<li>The mobile computing revolution began in the late 2000s with the
rise of smartphones and tablets.</li>
<li>ARM-based processors enabled ultra-low power use, allowing all-day
battery life.</li>
<li>Intel and AMD tried mobile pushes (e.g., Intel Atom), but ARM
dominated due to efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mobile devices support web browsing, social media, media playback,
gaming, and productivity.</li>
<li>They’ve become essential tools in daily life — from communication to
entertainment to work.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="low-power-connectivity-needs">Low Power &amp; Connectivity
Needs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Power efficiency is <strong>critical</strong>: mobile chips must
balance performance with battery life.</li>
<li>Always-on connectivity (Wi-Fi, LTE/5G, Bluetooth) is key for modern
usage.</li>
<li>ARM architectures prioritize low instruction complexity and
power-saving modes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="intelamd-mobile-cpus">Intel/AMD Mobile CPUs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Intel’s mobile chips (like Core i5/i7 U-series) are common in
laptops, focusing on performance per watt.</li>
<li>AMD’s Ryzen Mobile series competes with good graphics and
multithreading in thin-and-light devices.</li>
<li>Still, neither dominates <strong>phones/tablets</strong> — ARM
reigns in that space.</li>
</ul>
