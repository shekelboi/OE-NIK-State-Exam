<h3 id="why-process-level-parallelism">Why Process-Level
Parallelism?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Beyond threads, <strong>process-level parallelism</strong> exploits
multiple cores or multiple processors running <strong>separate
processes</strong> simultaneously.</li>
<li>Helps scale workloads that are heavy or independent.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="motivation-limits">Motivation &amp; Limits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some tasks are better split at the process level (e.g., web servers,
databases).</li>
<li>But limits exist due to <strong>Amdahl’s Law</strong> — speedup
limited by serial parts of code.</li>
<li>Also affected by <strong>communication overhead</strong> between
processes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="shared-vs-distributed-memory">Shared vs Distributed Memory</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared Memory:</strong> Multiple processors share the same
physical memory (easier communication).</li>
<li><strong>Distributed Memory:</strong> Each processor has its own
memory; communication happens via message passing (more scalable).</li>
</ul>
