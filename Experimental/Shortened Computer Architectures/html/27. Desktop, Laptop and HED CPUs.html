<h1 id="desktoplaptophedt-cpus">Desktop/Laptop/HEDT CPUs</h1>
<h3 id="core-counts">Core Counts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Desktop CPUs typically have 4 to 16 cores, balancing performance and
cost.</li>
<li>Laptop CPUs prioritize power efficiency and heat management, usually
with fewer cores (4â€“8 cores).</li>
<li>High-End Desktop (HEDT) CPUs push core counts up to 32 or more,
targeting content creators and enthusiasts needing heavy multitasking
and parallel workloads.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Desktop CPUs focus on single-thread and multi-thread performance for
gaming and productivity.</li>
<li>Laptop CPUs emphasize battery life and thermal limits, optimizing
for sustained performance under constraints.</li>
<li>HEDT CPUs excel in multi-threaded tasks like 3D rendering, video
editing, and scientific computing, with support for higher memory
bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="system-topology">System Topology</h3>
<ul>
<li>Desktop systems typically have a single CPU socket with direct
memory access.</li>
<li>Laptops integrate CPUs tightly with other components, including GPUs
and I/O controllers, to save space and power.</li>
<li>HEDT platforms often support multiple memory channels, larger
caches, and better I/O options for demanding workloads.</li>
</ul>
