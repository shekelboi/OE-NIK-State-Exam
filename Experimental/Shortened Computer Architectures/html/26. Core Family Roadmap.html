<h3 id="pentium-4-cancellation">Pentium 4 Cancellation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Intel cancelled the Pentium 4’s NetBurst line due to inefficiency
and heat issues.</li>
<li>Shifted focus to more efficient architectures with better
performance per watt.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="tick-tock-model">Tick-Tock Model</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Intel’s “Tick-Tock” was a cadence for CPU development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tick:</strong> New manufacturing process (smaller node)</li>
<li><strong>Tock:</strong> New microarchitecture on existing
process</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This model helped Intel deliver regular improvements for
years.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="key-developments">Key Developments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Later, Intel moved to a “Process-Architecture-Optimization” model
for finer incremental improvements.</li>
<li>Introduced major architectures like Sandy Bridge, Skylake, and
beyond.</li>
<li>Focus on balancing power, performance, and manufacturing challenges
shaped product evolution.</li>
</ul>
