Execution</h1>
<h3 id="what-is-it">What Is It?</h3>
<p>Parallel instruction execution is about running multiple instructions
at the same time to speed up processing. Instead of waiting for one
instruction to finish before starting the next, CPUs try to overlap
them.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="prefetching-and-instruction-overlap">Prefetching and Instruction
Overlap</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prefetching</strong> means fetching instructions ahead of
time before the CPU actually needs them.</li>
<li><strong>Instruction overlap</strong> happens when multiple
instructions are in different stages of execution simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="pipelining">Pipelining</h3>
<ul>
<li>The CPU breaks instruction execution into stages (fetch, decode,
execute, memory access, write-back).</li>
<li>Each stage works on a different instruction every clock cycle.</li>
<li>This increases throughput but can have bottlenecks.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="bottlenecks-and-mitigation">Bottlenecks and Mitigation</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Bottlenecks occur when instructions depend on results not yet
ready (data hazards) or when control flow changes (branch
hazards).</p></li>
<li><p>Techniques to reduce bottlenecks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Out-of-order execution</li>
<li>Branch prediction</li>
<li>Speculative execution</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
