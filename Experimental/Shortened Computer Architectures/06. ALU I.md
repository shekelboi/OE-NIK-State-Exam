# ALU I

### What Is the ALU?

The **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** is the part of the CPU that performs **math and logic operations**—like addition, subtraction, comparisons, AND, OR, etc.

It works with **registers** and connects to the CPU’s **data path**, forming the core of instruction execution.

### Components of the ALU

1. **Inputs:** Usually two operands from registers.
2. **Operation Selector:** Chooses the operation (add, sub, etc.).
3. **Output:** Result goes to a register or memory.
4. **Flags:** Sets status bits like Zero, Negative, Carry, Overflow.

### Single-Bit Adder

A simple logic circuit that adds **two 1-bit values** and a **carry-in**, producing:

* **Sum**
* **Carry-out**

Basic unit for building larger adders.

### n-Bit Adders

Built by chaining single-bit adders together:

* **Sequential (Ripple Carry) Adder:**
  Each bit waits for the carry from the previous one → **slow** for large numbers.

* **Parallel (Carry Lookahead) Adder:**
  Computes carries in advance → **much faster**.

### Adder with Carry

Useful when doing **multi-word addition** (e.g., adding two 64-bit numbers in 32-bit chunks).

The carry-out from one addition becomes the carry-in for the next.
