# Control Unit

### What is the Control Unit (CU)?

The Control Unit is the **brain inside the CPU** that directs the operation of the processor. It tells other parts what to do, when, and how.

### Hard-Wired Control Unit

* Implements control logic using **fixed combinational circuits** (gates, flip-flops).
* Fast and efficient but **not flexible** â€” changing behavior requires redesigning hardware.

---

### What the CU Controls

* **Instruction fetch and decode**
* **Generating control signals** for ALU, registers, memory access
* **Managing sequencing** of multi-step instructions
* **Handling interrupts and exceptions**

---

### How it Works

* Decodes instruction opcode into control signals.
* Coordinates data paths to execute instructions step-by-step.
* Often modeled as a **finite state machine (FSM)** cycling through states like fetch, decode, execute.

### Hardwired CU vs Microprogrammed CU (brief mention)

* **Hardwired:** fast, hardware fixed control signals.
* **Microprogrammed:** uses a control memory with microinstructions for flexibility (covered later).
