## Thermal Management

### Dissipation Focus

* Modern CPUs generate significant heat; managing this is critical for performance and reliability.
* Thermal dissipation involves transferring heat away from the CPU to prevent overheating.

### Reduction Methods

* Techniques include improved cooling solutions (air, liquid), heat spreaders, and heat pipes.
* Architectural methods like dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) reduce power under load.
* Power gating shuts off unused parts of the chip to save energy and reduce heat.

### Thermal Reserves

* CPUs include thermal headroomâ€”extra margin before hitting critical temperatures.
* This allows short bursts of high performance without immediate throttling.
* Efficient thermal management balances performance with longevity and user comfort.
