# Power & Energy

### Power Trends in CPUs

* As CPUs get faster and more complex, **power consumption increases** dramatically.
* This rise leads to the **“Power Wall”**, where cooling and battery life limit performance improvements.
* Power limits restrict clock speed scaling and chip complexity.

### Reducing Power Consumption

Techniques to reduce power:

* **Dynamic power reduction:** Lowering voltage and clock frequency during less demanding tasks.
* **Clock gating:** Turning off the clock signal to idle parts of the processor.
* **Power gating:** Completely shutting off power to unused blocks.
* **Multi-core designs:** Use multiple lower-power cores instead of one high-power core.

### Dynamic Energy and Power

* **Dynamic power** is mainly due to switching activity — charging and discharging capacitors in circuits.
* Formula:
  $P_{dynamic} = C \times V^2 \times f \times \alpha$
  where:

  * $C$ = capacitance
  * $V$ = voltage
  * $f$ = frequency
  * $\alpha$ = activity factor (how often gates switch)

### Static Power

* Caused by **leakage currents** even when transistors are idle.
* Becomes significant with smaller transistor sizes (deep submicron technologies).
* Harder to reduce than dynamic power.
