# Sequential Consistency

### What Does It Mean?

Sequential consistency ensures that the results of execution are **as if all instructions were executed in program order**, across all cores or threads. Even if actual execution is out of order (for performance), it must appear ordered.

### **Instruction and Memory Order**

* All processors execute instructions in a way that seems **interleaved**,
* But **each processorâ€™s own instructions stay in order**.
* No processor sees memory effects from another out of the expected order.

---

### **Interrupt Consistency**

If an interrupt occurs:

* It must appear **after all previous instructions** in that core have completed.
* This ensures a **predictable system state** when handling exceptions or events.

---

### **Reorder Buffer (ROB)**

A ROB tracks and holds instructions that:

* Execute **out of order**, but
* **Commit results in order** to memory and registers.

This makes execution faster but preserves consistency.

### **Reservation Stations**

* Hold instructions waiting for operands.
* Instructions **wake up** when data becomes available (e.g., from another unit).
* Allows more **parallelism** without breaking program order at commit time.
