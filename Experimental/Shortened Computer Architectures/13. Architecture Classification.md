# Architecture Classification

### **Flynn’s Taxonomy**

A classic way to categorize computer architectures based on **instruction and data streams**:

* **SISD** – *Single Instruction, Single Data*
  Traditional sequential processors (like classic CPUs).

* **SIMD** – *Single Instruction, Multiple Data*
  One instruction acts on many data points. Used in vector processing and multimedia (e.g., GPUs, SSE/AVX).

* **MISD** – *Multiple Instruction, Single Data*
  Rare or theoretical. Multiple processors perform different operations on the same data.

* **MIMD** – *Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data*
  Common in multicore/multiprocessor systems. Each core runs its own instruction stream on different data.

### **Modern Classifications**

Newer systems can blur these lines, so we also see terms like:

* **Superscalar** – Executes multiple instructions per cycle from a single thread.
* **VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word)** – Groups several operations into one wide instruction.
* **SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Threads)** – Like SIMD, but each thread can follow its own control flow (common in GPUs).
