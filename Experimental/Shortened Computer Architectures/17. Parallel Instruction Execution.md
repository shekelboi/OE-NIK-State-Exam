# Parallel Instruction Execution

### What Is It?

Parallel instruction execution is about running multiple instructions at the same time to speed up processing. Instead of waiting for one instruction to finish before starting the next, CPUs try to overlap them.

### Prefetching and Instruction Overlap

* **Prefetching** means fetching instructions ahead of time before the CPU actually needs them.
* **Instruction overlap** happens when multiple instructions are in different stages of execution simultaneously.

---

### Pipelining

* The CPU breaks instruction execution into stages (fetch, decode, execute, memory access, write-back).
* Each stage works on a different instruction every clock cycle.
* This increases throughput but can have bottlenecks.

---

### Bottlenecks and Mitigation

* Bottlenecks occur when instructions depend on results not yet ready (data hazards) or when control flow changes (branch hazards).
* Techniques to reduce bottlenecks:

  * Out-of-order execution
  * Branch prediction
  * Speculative execution
