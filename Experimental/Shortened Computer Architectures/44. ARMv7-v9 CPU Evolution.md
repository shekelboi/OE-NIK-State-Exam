# ARMv7â€“v9 CPU Evolution

### 32-bit to 64-bit Transition

* ARMv7 is a 32-bit architecture widely used in older devices.
* ARMv8 introduced 64-bit support (AArch64), enabling larger memory addressing and improved performance.

---

### big.LITTLE Development

* Evolved from ARMv7 big.LITTLE to more sophisticated implementations in ARMv8 and ARMv9.
* Modern designs allow finer-grained power management and more dynamic core usage.

### ARMv8.2 and ARMv9 Advancements

* ARMv8.2 added features like improved virtualization, enhanced cryptography, and better floating-point performance.
* ARMv9 focuses on security (confidential computing), AI acceleration, and further performance improvements.
