# Data Files & Manipulations

### Core Concepts

#### **1. Logical vs. Physical Memory**

* **Logical memory** (aka *virtual memory*): The address space your program thinks it has.

  * Managed by the OS.
  * Gives the illusion of a large, continuous memory.
* **Physical memory**: Actual RAM hardware.

  * Smaller and limited.
  * Mapped from logical memory via page tables.

#### **2. Registers vs. Memory**

* **Registers**: Tiny, ultra-fast memory inside the CPU.

  * Used for current operations.
  * Limited in number (e.g., 16–32 general-purpose).
* **Main memory (RAM)**: Much slower but larger.

  * Used for storing larger data sets and program state.

#### **3. Addressing Modes**

Tell the CPU how to interpret the operand in an instruction.

* **Immediate**: Value is given directly.

  * `MOV R1, #5` → Move value 5 into register R1
* **Direct**: Address points straight to the value.

  * `MOV R1, [1000]` → Move value at address 1000 to R1
* **Register**: Operand is in a register.

  * `ADD R1, R2`
* **Indirect**: Register holds the address.

  * `MOV R1, [R2]`
* **Indexed**: Combines a base address + index.

  * `MOV R1, [R2 + R3]`
  * Often used in arrays or loops.

### Example: Indexed Addressing in Context

If you have an array of integers and want to access element 5:

* Base register holds the address of the start of the array.
* Index register holds the offset (5 × element size).
* CPU adds base + index → final memory address.
