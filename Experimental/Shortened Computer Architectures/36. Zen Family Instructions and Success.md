# Zen Family Introduction & Success

### Launch & Impact

* AMD launched the Zen microarchitecture in 2017, marking a major comeback with improved IPC, power efficiency, and multi-threading.

---

### Modular Design

* Zen uses Core Complexes (CCXs), modular blocks of 4 cores each, allowing scalable and cost-effective CPU designs.

---

### Multi-Chip Modules (MCMs)

* Combines multiple silicon dies into one package, improving manufacturing yields and enabling high core counts.

---

### Market Disruption

* Zen challenged Intel’s dominance by delivering strong performance at competitive prices, shaking up the CPU market.

---

### Ecosystem Growth

* Success of Zen enabled AMD’s Ryzen, Threadripper, and EPYC product lines across desktop, HED, and server segments.
