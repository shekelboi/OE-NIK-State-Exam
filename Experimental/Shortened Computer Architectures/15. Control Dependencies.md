# Control Dependencies

### **What Are Control Dependencies?**

Control dependencies occur when the execution of certain instructions depends on the outcome of a previous branch or jump instruction. In other words, whether or not an instruction executes depends on a decision made during runtime. This is common with conditional branches where the CPU must decide which path of the program to follow next.

### **Why They Are Important**

Branches and jumps interrupt the smooth, sequential flow of instructions in a pipeline. Since the CPU doesnâ€™t know the outcome of a branch until it is evaluated, it must either wait (stall) or guess the path. Waiting reduces performance, but guessing incorrectly means the CPU has to discard work it has already started, which wastes cycles and energy.

### **Types of Branches**

* **Conditional Branches**: These depend on a condition (e.g., a comparison between registers). For example, a branch that only executes if two values are equal (`BEQ`). The CPU must evaluate the condition before continuing, which can cause delays.

* **Unconditional Branches**: These always cause a jump to another instruction location, redirecting program flow without any condition.

### **Branch Prediction Techniques**

To mitigate the delays caused by control dependencies, CPUs use branch prediction:

* **Static Prediction**: Assumes branches will always be taken or not taken based on simple rules. For example, always assuming backward loops are taken.

* **Dynamic Prediction**: Uses runtime information and history to make smarter guesses about branch outcomes. This includes techniques like local and global branch predictors that keep track of past behavior to predict future branches.

* **Speculative Execution**: The CPU guesses the branch outcome and continues executing instructions along that predicted path before the actual branch result is known. If the guess is right, the CPU saves time; if wrong, it must discard the speculative work and recover.

Control dependencies are a key challenge for modern CPUs because incorrect predictions cause pipeline flushes, leading to lost performance. Advances in prediction accuracy have been crucial to improving processor speed.
