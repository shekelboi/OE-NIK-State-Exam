# ARM ISA Development

### Base ISA

* ARMâ€™s Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) defines the instructions a CPU understands.
* The base ISA started with simple 32-bit instructions focused on RISC principles (Reduced Instruction Set Computing).

---

### Version History

* ARM ISA evolved through versions like ARMv4, v5, v6, v7, and the recent 64-bit ARMv8 and ARMv9.
* Each version added new features, improved performance, and expanded capabilities.

### Extension Focuses

* Extensions include support for SIMD (NEON), virtualization, security (TrustZone), and enhanced floating-point operations.
* ARMv8 introduced AArch64, a 64-bit execution state, enabling larger address spaces and improved performance.
