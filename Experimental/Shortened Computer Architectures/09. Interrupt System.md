# Interrupt System

### What is an Interrupt?

An **interrupt** is a signal that tells the CPU to stop what it's doing and handle something more urgent.

### Why Do Interrupts Exist?

* Devices like keyboards, timers, and disks can't wait for the CPU to check them constantly.
* So they send an **interrupt signal** when they need attention â€” efficient and event-driven.

---

### Types of Interrupts

* **Hardware Interrupts:**
  Sent by external devices (e.g., keyboard input, disk finished reading).

* **Software Interrupts (Traps):**
  Generated by running programs (e.g., system calls).

* **Exceptions:**
  Special kind of interrupt from errors during execution (e.g., illegal instruction).

### Interrupt vs Exception

| Feature      | Interrupt              | Exception              |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Source       | External (I/O devices) | Internal (CPU faults)  |
| Predictable? | No                     | Yes (usually)          |
| Triggered by | Events                 | Errors or system calls |

### What Happens During an Interrupt?

1. CPU **saves current state** (e.g., PC, registers).
2. **Jumps to interrupt handler** (special routine).
3. Handles the event.
4. **Restores state** and resumes where it left off.
