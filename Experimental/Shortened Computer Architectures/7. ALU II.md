# ALU II

### BCD Encoding

* **BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal)** stores each decimal digit (0–9) as a 4-bit binary number.
* Used in financial and commercial systems where decimal precision matters.
* Requires special handling in arithmetic to correct results (like BCD addition corrections).

---

### Floating-Point Basics

* Represents **real numbers** (including fractions and very large/small numbers).
* Uses three parts:

  * **Sign bit** (positive/negative)
  * **Exponent** (scales the number)
  * **Mantissa (or significand)** (precision bits)

---

### IEEE 754 Standard

* Defines formats for floating-point numbers, commonly:

  * **Single precision:** 32 bits
  * **Double precision:** 64 bits

* Specifies how to represent special values:

  * Zero, Infinity, NaN (Not a Number)
  * Denormalized numbers for very small values

---

### Rounding and Exceptions

* Rounding is needed because many real numbers can’t be represented exactly. Common modes:

  * Round to nearest (default)
  * Round toward zero
  * Round up/down

* Exceptions: overflow, underflow, divide by zero, invalid operation trigger special flags.

### Floating-Point Arithmetic

* Operations follow rules for exponent alignment, mantissa calculation, normalization, and rounding.
* More complex and slower than integer arithmetic but essential for scientific computing.
