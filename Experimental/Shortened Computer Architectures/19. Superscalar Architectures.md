# Superscalar Architectures

### What Is Superscalar?

A **superscalar architecture** is designed to execute **multiple instructions simultaneously** during each clock cycle. It achieves this by having several functional units (like ALUs, multipliers) that work in parallel.

### Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP)

* ILP allows the CPU to identify independent instructions that can run at the same time.
* The processor dynamically schedules and issues multiple instructions per cycle.
* This boosts performance by utilizing CPU resources efficiently.

### Harvard Architecture

* Superscalar CPUs often use a **Harvard architecture**, separating instruction and data memory.
* This separation allows **simultaneous fetching** of instructions and reading/writing data, reducing memory access conflicts.

### CISC vs. RISC

* **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing):**

  * Instructions can perform complex tasks in one instruction (multi-step internally).
  * Example: x86 architecture.
  * Pros: fewer instructions per program.
  * Cons: harder to pipeline and parallelize.

* **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing):**

  * Simpler, fixed-length instructions.
  * Designed for pipelining and parallelism.
  * Example: ARM processors.
  * Pros: faster instruction throughput, easier to optimize for superscalar.

### Branch Prediction in Superscalar CPUs

* Branch instructions cause uncertainty in instruction flow.
* Superscalar CPUs use **branch prediction** to guess which way a branch will go to keep pipelines full.
* Techniques include **static** (fixed rules) and **dynamic** (based on runtime history) prediction.
* Good branch prediction is crucial to maintain high ILP and avoid pipeline stalls.
