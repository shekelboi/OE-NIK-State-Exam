# Zen Overview

### With/Without GPU

* Some Zen-based CPUs include integrated graphics (APUs), like the Ryzen G-series (e.g., 3200G, 3400G).
* Others, especially high-performance models (Ryzen 7/9, Threadripper), come **without** a GPU, requiring a discrete graphics card.

#### APU Highlights

* APUs combine Zen CPU cores with Vega GPU cores.
* Ideal for budget systems or compact builds needing decent graphics without a separate GPU.

### Packaging

* Zen CPUs use a **modular chiplet design**, allowing for flexibility across product lines.
* Desktop CPUs often use AM4 sockets, while server and HEDT chips use larger packages (e.g., sTRX4, SP3).
* Multi-chip packages improve manufacturing and scalability, especially for high core counts.

### Pro Models

* AMD offers **Ryzen Pro** models targeting business users.
* Features include hardware security (like Memory Guard), longer lifecycle, and commercial-grade reliability.
* Pro variants exist across desktop and mobile lines, often mirroring regular Ryzen SKUs with added features.
