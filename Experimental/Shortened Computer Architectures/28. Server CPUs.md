# Server CPUs

### Core Counts

* Server CPUs often have very high core counts — 32, 64, or more — to handle many simultaneous tasks.
* Designed to optimize throughput and efficiency across multiple virtual machines and services.

---

### Memory Bandwidth

* Servers require high memory bandwidth to feed data-hungry applications like databases and virtualization.
* Multiple memory channels and support for large amounts of RAM (hundreds of GBs to TBs) are common.

### UMA and NUMA Architectures

* **Uniform Memory Access (UMA):** All processors share a common memory space with uniform access latency.
* **Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA):** Memory is divided among processors, with faster local access and slower remote access.
* NUMA improves scalability in multi-socket systems but requires software to manage memory locality.
