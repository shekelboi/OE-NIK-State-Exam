# Associative & Multilevel Caches

### **Associative Cache Types**

* **Direct-Mapped Cache**<br>
  Each memory block maps to exactly **one cache line**. Simple and fast, but prone to collisions (conflicts).

* **Fully Associative Cache**<br>
  A memory block can be stored in **any cache line**. Flexible, fewer conflicts, but slower and more complex.

* **Set-Associative Cache**<br>
  A middle ground. Cache is divided into sets; a block maps to one set but can occupy any line within that set (e.g., 4-way associative means 4 lines per set).

### **Advantages of Associativity**

* Higher associativity generally **reduces conflict misses**.
* But it **increases complexity** and access time due to searching multiple lines.

### **Multilevel Caches**

* To balance speed, size, and cost, modern CPUs use multiple cache levels:

  * **L1 Cache:** Smallest, fastest, closest to the CPU core.
  * **L2 Cache:** Larger, slightly slower.
  * **L3 Cache:** Shared among cores, larger and slower than L2.

* This hierarchy improves average access time by catching data sooner at faster caches.
