# Ryzen Line

### Pure Power

* Uses on-chip sensors to monitor **voltage, temperature, and frequency**.
* Dynamically adjusts power to improve **efficiency** and reduce heat.

---

### Precision Boost

* Automatically boosts clock speeds based on **workload and thermal headroom**.
* Works per-core — higher performance for light or moderate tasks.

---

### XFR (eXtended Frequency Range)

* An extension of Precision Boost.
* If you have **better cooling**, it pushes clocks even **higher** beyond standard boost limits.

---

### StoreMI

* Combines an SSD and HDD into a **virtual single drive**.
* Uses SSD as a cache to speed up frequently accessed files on slower storage.
* Similar to Intel’s Optane caching idea.

---

### Control Triangle

* Balance between **power**, **performance**, and **temperature**.
* Ryzen dynamically shifts within this triangle to optimize behavior based on system conditions.
