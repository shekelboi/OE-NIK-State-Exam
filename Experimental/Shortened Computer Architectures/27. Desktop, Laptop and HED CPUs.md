# Desktop/Laptop/HEDT CPUs

### Core Counts

* Desktop CPUs typically have 4 to 16 cores, balancing performance and cost.
* Laptop CPUs prioritize power efficiency and heat management, usually with fewer cores (4â€“8 cores).
* High-End Desktop (HEDT) CPUs push core counts up to 32 or more, targeting content creators and enthusiasts needing heavy multitasking and parallel workloads.

### Performance

* Desktop CPUs focus on single-thread and multi-thread performance for gaming and productivity.
* Laptop CPUs emphasize battery life and thermal limits, optimizing for sustained performance under constraints.
* HEDT CPUs excel in multi-threaded tasks like 3D rendering, video editing, and scientific computing, with support for higher memory bandwidth.

### System Topology

* Desktop systems typically have a single CPU socket with direct memory access.
* Laptops integrate CPUs tightly with other components, including GPUs and I/O controllers, to save space and power.
* HEDT platforms often support multiple memory channels, larger caches, and better I/O options for demanding workloads.
