# In-Package Integration

### MCMs (Multi-Chip Modules)

* Instead of one big monolithic die, AMD uses **multiple smaller dies** in a single package.
* These are easier and cheaper to manufacture — better **yield** and **scalability**.
* Example: Ryzen, Threadripper, and Epyc all use MCM design.

### Homogeneous vs. Heterogeneous Dies

* **Homogeneous:** All dies are the same type — e.g., all CPU cores.
* **Heterogeneous:** Mix of different dies — CPU + GPU, or CPU + IO.
* AMD uses both depending on the product (e.g., Ryzen vs. APU).

---

### Horizontal & Vertical Integration

* **Horizontal:** Linking dies side-by-side (e.g., multiple CPU dies).
* **Vertical:** Integration of different functions — logic + memory, or stacking layers (3D V-Cache, for example).
* This improves **density** and **performance per watt**.

### Power Limits

* Managing multiple dies in one package needs tight **power coordination**.
* Features like **Power Cap** ensure system stays within thermal and power envelopes.
* Essential for high-core-count CPUs like Epyc.
