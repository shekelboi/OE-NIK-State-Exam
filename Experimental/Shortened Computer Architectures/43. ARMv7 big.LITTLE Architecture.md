# ARMv7 big.LITTLE Architectures

### Evolution

* Introduced by ARM to combine high-performance cores with energy-efficient cores in one chip.
* Enables better power management by switching between cores based on workload.

---

### Operation Principle

* **Big cores:** High power, high performance, handle heavy tasks.
* **LITTLE cores:** Low power, energy-efficient, handle light or background tasks.
* The system dynamically migrates tasks between big and LITTLE cores for optimal efficiency.

### Benefits

* Improved battery life without sacrificing performance.
* Flexibility to balance speed and energy use depending on current needs.
