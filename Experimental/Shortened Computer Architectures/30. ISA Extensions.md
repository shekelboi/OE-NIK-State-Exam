# ISA Extensions

### x86 Extensions

* Intel and AMD extended the base x86 instruction set to add specialized features and improve performance.
* Examples include MMX, SSE, AVX â€” mainly aimed at accelerating multimedia, scientific, and parallel workloads.

### SIMD Details

* Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) allows one instruction to operate on multiple data points simultaneously.
* ISA extensions add wider vector registers and new instructions to speed up processing of audio, video, encryption, and more.
* E.g., AVX-512 supports 512-bit wide vectors, enabling highly parallel computations.

### Other Extensions

* Extensions also target security (e.g., Intel SGX), virtualization (VT-x), and power management.
* ISA extensions evolve to meet new software demands without changing the entire architecture.
