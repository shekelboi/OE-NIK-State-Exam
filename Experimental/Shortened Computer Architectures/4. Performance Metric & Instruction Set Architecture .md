# Performance Metric & Instruction Set Architecture

### **Classes of Computers**

* **Desktop** – Balanced performance.
* **Server** – High throughput, I/O-heavy, optimized for reliability.
* **Embedded** – Resource-constrained, specialized function.
* **Mobile** – Power-efficient, thermal-sensitive.

---

### **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**

* Defines how software communicates with hardware.
* Includes instruction formats, types, registers, addressing modes, etc.

---

### **CPU Performance Formula**

$$
\text{CPU Time} = \frac{\text{Instruction Count} \times \text{CPI}}{\text{Clock Rate}}
$$

* **Instruction Count (IC)** – Number of instructions executed.
* **CPI (Cycles per Instruction)** – Avg. cycles per instruction.
* **Clock Rate** – CPU speed in Hz.

### **MIPS (Millions of Instructions Per Second)**

* Quick metric but misleading—it doesn’t account for instruction complexity.
