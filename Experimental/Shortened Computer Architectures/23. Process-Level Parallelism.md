# Process-Level Parallelism

### Why Process-Level Parallelism?

* Beyond threads, **process-level parallelism** exploits multiple cores or multiple processors running **separate processes** simultaneously.
* Helps scale workloads that are heavy or independent.

### Motivation & Limits

* Some tasks are better split at the process level (e.g., web servers, databases).
* But limits exist due to **Amdahl’s Law** — speedup limited by serial parts of code.
* Also affected by **communication overhead** between processes.

### Shared vs Distributed Memory

* **Shared Memory:** Multiple processors share the same physical memory (easier communication).
* **Distributed Memory:** Each processor has its own memory; communication happens via message passing (more scalable).
