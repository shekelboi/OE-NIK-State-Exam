# Cache Write Policies

### **Write-Through**

* Every write updates **both cache and main memory**
* Easy to implement, but creates **high memory traffic**
* Memory always reflects the latest data

---

### **Write-Back**

* Writes update **only the cache** initially
* Main memory is updated **later**, when the block is evicted
* Needs a **dirty bit** to track changes
* Reduces memory traffic, but more complex

---

### **Write Allocation**

* On a **write miss**, **fetch the block** into the cache, then write
* Assumes future writes to the same block
* Common with **write-back**

---

### **Write-Around**

* On a **write miss**, write directly to **main memory**
* **Skip loading** into the cache
* Keeps cache clean, but each miss is costly
