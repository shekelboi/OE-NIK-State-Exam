# Zen 2 Development

### Processor Types

* Zen 2 powers the Ryzen 3000 series for desktops, the 2nd-gen Epyc server processors (7002 series), and 3rd-gen Threadripper.
* It brought significant IPC (instructions per cycle) improvements and better power efficiency compared to the original Zen.

### Chipset Selections

* Zen 2 introduced support for new chipsets like AMDâ€™s X570, which was the first to offer PCIe 4.0.
* This provided faster data transfer rates, better memory support, and enhanced I/O performance.

### Implementation

* Built on a 7nm manufacturing process, Zen 2 chips have higher transistor density, enabling more cores and better thermals.
* The modular MCM design continued, with multiple chiplets connected through Infinity Fabric, improving bandwidth and latency.

#### Architectural Improvements

* Redesigned core layout to reduce latency between cores and caches.
* Enhanced branch prediction and prefetching for higher performance.
* Improved security features with mitigations for Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities.
