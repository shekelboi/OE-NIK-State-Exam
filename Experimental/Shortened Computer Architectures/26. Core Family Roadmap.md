# Core Family Roadmap

### Pentium 4 Cancellation

* Intel cancelled the Pentium 4’s NetBurst line due to inefficiency and heat issues.
* Shifted focus to more efficient architectures with better performance per watt.

---

### Tick-Tock Model

* Intel’s “Tick-Tock” was a cadence for CPU development:

  * **Tick:** New manufacturing process (smaller node)
  * **Tock:** New microarchitecture on existing process
* This model helped Intel deliver regular improvements for years.

---

### Key Developments

* Later, Intel moved to a “Process-Architecture-Optimization” model for finer incremental improvements.
* Introduced major architectures like Sandy Bridge, Skylake, and beyond.
* Focus on balancing power, performance, and manufacturing challenges shaped product evolution.
