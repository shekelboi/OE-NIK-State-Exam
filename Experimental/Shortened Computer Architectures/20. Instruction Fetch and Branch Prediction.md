# Instruction Fetch & Branch Prediction

### Instruction Fetch

* The **Instruction Fetch Unit** is responsible for pulling instructions from memory.
* In superscalar CPUs, it must **fetch multiple instructions per cycle** to keep parallel pipelines filled.
* Fetching is more complex due to **variable-length instructions** (like in x86) and branch instructions.

### Branch Prediction

To avoid stalling pipelines when a **branch** (like `if` or `loop`) occurs, CPUs **guess** the outcome ahead of time.

#### Local Prediction

* Uses the **history of a single branch**.
* Example: “This branch was taken the last 3 times, so probably will be again.”

#### Correlating Predictor

* Also called **two-level** or **global predictors**.
* Uses **history of multiple branches** to make predictions.

#### Tournament Predictor

* Combines several predictors and **chooses the best** based on recent accuracy.
* Adapts to different branch behaviors.

### Branch Target Prediction

* Predicts not just **whether** to branch, but **where to jump**.
* Uses a **Branch Target Buffer (BTB)** to store likely destinations.
