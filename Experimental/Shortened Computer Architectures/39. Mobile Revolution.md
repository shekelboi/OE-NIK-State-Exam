# Mobile Revolution

### History

* The mobile computing revolution began in the late 2000s with the rise of smartphones and tablets.
* ARM-based processors enabled ultra-low power use, allowing all-day battery life.
* Intel and AMD tried mobile pushes (e.g., Intel Atom), but ARM dominated due to efficiency.

### Use Cases

* Mobile devices support web browsing, social media, media playback, gaming, and productivity.
* They’ve become essential tools in daily life — from communication to entertainment to work.

### Low Power & Connectivity Needs

* Power efficiency is **critical**: mobile chips must balance performance with battery life.
* Always-on connectivity (Wi-Fi, LTE/5G, Bluetooth) is key for modern usage.
* ARM architectures prioritize low instruction complexity and power-saving modes.

### Intel/AMD Mobile CPUs

* Intel’s mobile chips (like Core i5/i7 U-series) are common in laptops, focusing on performance per watt.
* AMD’s Ryzen Mobile series competes with good graphics and multithreading in thin-and-light devices.
* Still, neither dominates **phones/tablets** — ARM reigns in that space.
