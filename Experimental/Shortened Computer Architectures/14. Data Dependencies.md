# Data Dependencies

### **What Are They?**

In a pipeline or parallel execution environment, **data dependencies** determine whether instructions can execute independently or must wait on each other.

### **Types of Data Dependencies**

1. **RAW (Read After Write)** — *True Dependency*<br>
   An instruction needs a value that hasn’t been computed yet.

   ```
   ADD R1, R2, R3
   SUB R4, R1, R5   ; must wait for ADD
   ```

2. **WAR (Write After Read)** — *Anti-Dependency*<br>
   A write might overwrite a value that needs to be read first.

   ```
   READ R1
   WRITE R1         ; must wait for read to finish
   ```

3. **WAW (Write After Write)** — *Output Dependency*<br>
   Two instructions write to the same register — must preserve the order.

   ```
   WRITE R1
   WRITE R1         ; later write must go last
   ```

### **Why Do They Matter?**

* **Hazards** in the pipeline stall execution.
* **Out-of-order execution** and **register renaming** are used to hide or resolve them.
* Instruction-level parallelism (ILP) depends heavily on minimizing these dependencies.

---

### **Register Renaming**

Registers are limited and reused in programs, which can cause false dependencies (especially WAR and WAW).

**Register renaming** solves this by:

* Mapping architectural registers (the ones programmers see) to a larger pool of **physical registers**.
* This way, two instructions writing to the same architectural register can use different physical registers, removing false dependencies.
* Result: better instruction-level parallelism because the CPU sees them as independent.

---

### **Out-of-Order Execution**

Normally, instructions execute in program order, but this can cause stalls due to dependencies or resource waits.

Out-of-order execution lets the CPU:

* **Execute instructions as soon as their operands are ready**, even if earlier instructions are still waiting.
* Uses buffers and reorder mechanisms to keep results consistent.
* Improves CPU utilization and performance by reducing idle time.
