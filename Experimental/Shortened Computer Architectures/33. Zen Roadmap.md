# Zen Roadmap

### Zen to Zen+

* **Zen** (2017) marked AMD’s comeback — a brand-new architecture with strong IPC (Instructions Per Cycle) gains.
* **Zen+** improved on Zen with a refined 12nm process, better clock speeds, and lower latencies (especially L3).

---

### Core Complexes (CCX)

* AMD’s CPUs use **Core Complexes** — small blocks of 4–8 cores sharing some resources like L3 cache.
* This modular approach helps scaling across product lines.

---

### Zeppelin

* Codename for the first Zen-based SoC (System on Chip).
* Used in Ryzen, Threadripper, and Epyc CPUs.
* Multiple Zeppelins could be linked to create high-core-count processors.

---

### Threadripper & Epyc

* **Threadripper**: High-core desktop/workstation CPUs for enthusiasts and creators.
* **Epyc**: Server-grade CPUs, designed for scale and bandwidth.

---

### Infinity Fabric

* AMD’s high-speed interconnect linking CCXs, memory controllers, I/O, and even dies.
* Essential for multi-chip scaling and performance consistency.
