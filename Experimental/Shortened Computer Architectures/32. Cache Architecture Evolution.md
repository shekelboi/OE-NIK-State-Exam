# Cache Architecture Evolution

### L1–L4 Levels

* Modern CPUs feature multiple levels of cache:

  * **L1**: Fastest, smallest, per core.
  * **L2**: Larger, still fast, often per core.
  * **L3**: Shared among cores, bigger, slower.
  * **L4** (in some CPUs): Even larger, used as a buffer for memory access (e.g., Intel eDRAM).

### Per-Core / Shared

* L1 and L2 caches are typically **dedicated per core** — ensures low latency and avoids contention.
* L3 and L4 are often **shared**, promoting efficient inter-core communication and reducing redundancy.

### Unified / Split Caches

* **Unified caches** store both data and instructions (common in L2, L3).
* **Split caches** separate instruction and data caches (usually in L1) for faster parallel access.
* Split caches reduce instruction-data interference, speeding up processing.
