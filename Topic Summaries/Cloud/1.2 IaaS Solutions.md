## AWS Regions and Availability Zones

Region is a geographic location that consists of two or more availability zones. An availability zone is a cluster of data centers located in the same place. Availability zones are spread across the region (typically 15 to 200 km away from each other). Regions are connected by the AWS backbone network. 

Using the appropriate region helps with reducing latency, complying with regulations (data storage in a specific country) and disaster recovery. Each region has its own pricing.

## EC2

AWS's compute service that offers virtual servers (instances). It can be extended with autoscaling and load balancing to handle higher volume of traffic.

### Configuration

Configuration options include the AMI (Amazon Machine Image) which will define the OS of the instance, instance type (computing capacity), network options (VPC, automatic public IP, firewall settings, configuring SSH), storage options and user data (script to be executed for setup).

## Storage Types

* Block storage - typically for mission-critical services. As the name implies the data is stored in blocks and reassembled as needed. It has two types:
    * Instance store - ephemeral storage
    * EBS (Elastic Store Block) - persistent storage, e.g. for the OS
* Object storage - S3 (Simple Storage Service) offers object storage. S3 is highly reliable and may even be used for hosting static websites. It has different kinds, e.g. glacier or glacier deep archive for archiving.
* File storage - AWS offers two types high performance network file systems (ideal when multiple users need access to the same data):
    * EFS (Elastic File System) - it relies on NFS, thus it is only suitable for Linux based servers.
    * FSx (Windows File Server)
